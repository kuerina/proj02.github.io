      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, My name is Hugo Trivino, and I am a computer engineer and science
        student from Chilean Patagonia. I joined the workforce at a young age
        after I graduated high school at age 17. I left Patagonia and traveled
        some two thousand miles north to the Atacama desert to work. For the
        next six years, I worked for different mining service companies
        including Sodexo, Compass-Group, and Esperanza, where I got my first
        taste of programming. Working on one of the largest copper mine projects
        in the world, I taught myself how to program so I could do the most
        efficient and reliable work possible. Now at IIT, I am learning how to
        formalize my self taught skills (my code was hard on the eyes), and
        discovering the intricacies of hardware design. I want to understand
        hardware and make abstract problems faster to compute by doing so. I am
        passionate about a lifelong journey of learning and build the skills
        needed to address the fascinating problems found in fields such as data
        mining, social network analysis, machine learning, artificial
        intelligence, and cybersecurity.

      <ol>
          <li>GNU-Linux
              <p>Since I started using GNU-Linux in my personal computer, I fell
              in love with both the challenge of getting things to work and the
              power that users of UNIX get out of their versatile machines. I
              almost use Debian for all my personal computing adventures.
              Although I do have plenty of experience using windows environments
              (and Visual Basic) during all my years working in the mines.

          <li>Social Sciences 
            <p>I love social sciences as they provide us many different tools to
            measure the world around us and react accordingly. I study business
            administration at a technical high school back in Chile and I have
            taken some related classes in IIT. However, my interest for social
            sciences in general is way greater than a classroom experience.

          <li>Mathematics
              <p>I love math almost more than any other subject. I almost study
              math as a major, but I realize that programming was a more
              pragmatic choice that is not far remove from this beautiful
              subject.

          <li><h3>Natural and Applied Sciences</h3>
              <p>I always try to choose a subject because of the learning and the
              challenge they provide. For this reason I took the hardest electives when
              possible such as electrodynamics, thermodynamics, and material
              science instead of easier courses that would not give me the
              satisfaction of getting some insights out of nature.

              history is something that I feel passionate about. I love reading
              books or listening to podcast and audio books of almost any topic.
              I listened to the entire history of Rome podcast, hardcore
              history, history on fire, etc. Also, my dream is to learn at least
              the five widely spoken languages in the world. At the moment I am
              working in Chinese but is seems like is going to take a while. I
              have been to China and Indonesia to learn about their culture.
